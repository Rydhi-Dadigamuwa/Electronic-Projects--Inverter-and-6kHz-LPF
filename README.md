# Electronic Projects: Inverter and 6kHz LPF

## Overview

This repository contains two electronic projects:
1. **9th Order Butterworth Low Pass Filter (6 kHz Cutoff)**
2. **12V DC to 220V AC Inverter**

## Projects

### 1. 9th Order Butterworth Low Pass Filter (6 kHz Cutoff)

- **Description:** Designed and implemented a 9th order Butterworth low pass filter using the Sallen-Key approach. The filter has a cutoff frequency of 6 kHz.
- **Purpose:** To filter out high-frequency noise from a signal while allowing frequencies below 6 kHz to pass through.
- **Implementation:** The filter is designed for high-performance signal processing applications where precise frequency filtering is required.

### 2. 12V DC to 220V AC Inverter

- **Description:** Developed a pure sinusoidal inverter circuit to convert 12V DC to 220V AC at 50 Hz.
- **Purpose:** To provide a stable AC power source from a DC input, suitable for powering AC appliances or for use in applications requiring AC voltage.
- **Implementation:** The inverter circuit is designed to ensure a pure sine wave output, minimizing harmonic distortion and providing reliable power conversion.

## How to Use

1. **9th Order Butterworth LPF:**
   - Connect the input signal to the filter circuit.
   - The output will provide a filtered signal with frequencies below 6 kHz.

2. **12V DC to 220V AC Inverter:**
   - Connect a 12V DC power source to the input terminals.
   - The output terminals will provide a 220V AC sine wave signal.
